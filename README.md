## Opinionated protection from AIs and scanner bots.

Digital dome is a fast, minimal web application firewall that uses request information to protect a site against AI scanners.  It hosts several configurable rules, along with sensible (if aggressive) defaults.

## Routers: Echo

Silicon Dome currently ships with adapters for [labstack echo](https://echo.labstack.com).  Other router configurations
are easy to add

```
import github.com/benpate/digital-dome/dome
import github.com/benpate/digital-dome/dome4echo

// WAF Middleware
myDome := dome4echo.New()
e.Pre(myDome)
```
